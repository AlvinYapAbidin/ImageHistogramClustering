# Image Matcher Prototype Using OpenCV Histograms

This prototype demonstrates an image matcher system that utilizes OpenCV to apply histograms to images for clustering based on similarity. The system preprocesses images, computes their color histograms, and groups them into clusters using a histogram comparison method.
## Features

How It Works

- Preprocessing: Each image is resized and denoised. This step improves performance and reduces the impact of noise on histogram comparison.
- Histogram Calculation: For each preprocessed image, a color histogram in the RGB space is calculated. This histogram represents the color distribution of the image.
- Clustering: The system calculates the similarity between histograms using the correlation method. Images with histogram similarity above a predefined threshold are grouped into the same cluster.
- Visualization: The application displays each cluster's images sequentially, allowing users to review grouped images.

Customization

- Similarity Threshold: Adjust the SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD constant to change how strict the clustering is. A higher threshold requires more similarity for images to be clustered together.
- Image Preprocessing: Modify the removeNoise function to apply different denoising techniques based on your needs.

Limitations

- Performance: Large image datasets may slow down processing. Consider further resizing images or utilizing parallel processing techniques.
- Clustering Quality: The effectiveness of clustering depends on the chosen similarity threshold and the specific characteristics of the image dataset.
